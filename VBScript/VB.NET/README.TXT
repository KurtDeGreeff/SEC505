The purpose of these *.vb project files is to give a taste of VB.NET to programmers familiar with VBScript.  It may look a little strange or hard at first, but what doesn't?  A little effort (and fun!) and you'll be writing VB.NET code in no time!

The VB.NET binaries in the \bin folder require the .NET Framework to be installed in order to run.  You can download the .NET Framework for free from 

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/

You can also get the .NET Framework Software Development Kit (SDK) from this location, which you should do if you intend to write your own VB.NET code.

You can download Visual Studio Express, which is free, from http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/
